    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> Are there any correlations to make/color/body type to violation types?\n",
    "How does visual appearance affect the likelihood of receiving a parking violation? Do certain makes/models or colors receive more tickets than expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "> We predict that loud colors & higher end models have a higher chance of receiving violations.\n",
    "We hypothesize that visual appearance does affect the likelihood of receiving a parking violation. We expect that parking officials are more likely to notice cars that have loud colors and higher end models and thus more likely to give them a ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "> We believe that there are biases that are imposed from humans as they do their job, such as parking enforcement. There is a typically well known statement that cops and parking enforcement have to meet quotas monthly to keep them on goal as they do their job. Besides this commonly heard phenomena, is there also a possible data to show that some cars also get more tickets than others? With further research we found there are many articles online which sum up reasons why one might be more likely to get a ticket; and some of their data show that certain vehicle makes and models, more notably the expensive and luxurious make and models, receive more speeding tickets [1]. There is also a well known statistic that red colored cars get pulled over more than others, which is most likely related to its high visibility over other colored cars [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "> With this in mind, we supposed there can be a possible correlation to be found. As we hypothesized, we believe that cars of certain visible attributes like color or make can possibly increase their likelihood of receiving a ticket in comparison to other vehicles which may not attract as much attention. We believe this is important because we want to see if there are possible implicit biases in how parking enforcement gives out violations. This data could help better inform people before choosing a car to buy, if they care or to just find an interesting relationship to human cognition and how perception alters thinking.\n",

    "The data was posted on Kaggle’s data set page but the information is released to the public via DataLA, a public site maintained by the Los Angeles government. We have permission to use this data under the Open Database License. There are no privacy concerns in regard to the data. This data set is potentially biased in terms of who it composes for two reasons. The first is regional factors. For example if parking officials stay in a neighborhood where the parking restrictions are stricter then we would expect the models of the cars in that neighborhood to be over represented in the data set. The second reason is that some violations may be more for lower income individuals. For example we would expect lower income individuals to receive more expired registration violations because of their inability to afford registration. If we identify any of these issues, we can modify our research topic so that it does not include biased data. For example we will not analyze expired registration violations if we identify that the data is heavily skewed towards lower income models.\n",

    "In addition, our dataset was already efficient in not including much personal identifiers of the individuals whose vehicles have received citations. We practiced the Safe Harbor method, in which we removed the VIN column from our dataset to further improve its anonymization. Thus, our project considerably respects the privacy of the individuals whose vehicles received citations as we have altered the dataset to focus solely on the vehicles."
